# COVID-19 Dashboard

This project is an interactive Tableau-based COVID-19 Dashboard that visualizes the global progression of the pandemic. It provides insights into confirmed cases, death cases, and trends over time, helping users understand the impact of COVID-19 on different countries and regions.

The dashboard includes a world map showing confirmed and death cases across all countries, along with interactive features like a date filter to explore specific timeframes. Two pie charts display the breakdown of confirmed and death cases, while a bar chart highlights the top 10 most affected countries. Additionally, a line graph illustrates the increasing trends in cases over time, starting from the earliest stages of the pandemic.

The dashboard is designed to make complex data easier to comprehend and analyze. It serves as a valuable tool for monitoring the pandemicâ€™s progression and understanding its global impact. Through this project, I have demonstrated my skills in data visualization, storytelling with data, and the effective use of Tableau.

Feel free to explore the project by opening the Tableau workbook file. Feedback and suggestions are welcome!
